# Welcome to North Country Wild!  #
## Introduction ##
Wildlife can be secretive and thus difficult to study.  The invention of "camera traps"  (also called *"game cameras"* or *"trail cameras"*) has allowed humans to better learn about the habits of wildlife.  Hunters use camera traps to learn more about the movement and activity patterns of game species.  Scientists use camera traps to capture information about species living in a particular area.

## Our Project ##
Here in Northern New York (aka the "North Country") live many interesting creatures.  However, not much research has been done to study wildlife in our region.  The team at [Nature Up North](www.natureupnorth.org) is working with members of our community, and maybe even getting help from folks outside our community (might that describe YOU?), to learn more about the wildlife in our region.

## A2A ##
In addition, our region is located in the heart of what is called the "A2A" region (marked in red in the photo below). A2A stands for "Algonquin to Adirondack" and is the region of land that stretches between Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario, CA and the Adirondack State Park in New York, USA.  A group known as the [A2A Collaborative](http://www.a2acollaborative.org/) is working to connect habitat between the two parks.  Doing so will reduce the effects of habitat fragmentation and a changing climate on wildlife.  Thus, the more we learn about species in our region and their habitat needs, the better able we will be to plan an effective wildlife corridor in the A2A region.

We have placed camera traps in several forests within the A2A region (green dots on the map).  In phase 1 of the North Country Wild project, the pictures you are shown come from cameras located in those forests.  Future renditions of the project will also include images from cameras placed in a wider range of habitats across a wider spatial area, still within the A2A corridor.

## Goals ##
Our goals with this project are threefold:
 
1. Learn about the diversity of animals, and particularly mammals, in our region and their habitat requirements
2. Build greater understanding of how wildlife use space between the Adirondack mountains and the St. Lawrence River
3. Partner with residents and friends in our community to build greater understanding of and appreciation for our natural resources.

## 2019 Results ##
We had a total of **147 volunteers**. With your help, we classified 12808 events belonging to 73 of 96 cameras. Thanks to your support, we found several important findings: 

**1. We identified 21 different mammals species among all forest sites (including humans)**
19 mammals identified in pine forests
18 mammals identified in deciduous forests

White–tailed deer was most frequently detected mammal 
Mink, river otter, snowshoe hare, and owl were each detected on one camera

*Table 1 List of species detected by forest. Forest abbreviations: BC = Beaver Creek, DEG = Degrasse, DON = Donnerville, SH = South Hammond, WF = Whiskey Flats, WHIP = Whippoorwill Corners. Each "x" indicates species presence recorded in the corresponding forest. Percent of forests is the percent of forests in which each species was detected. Naïve occupancy (%) is the percent of cameras at which a species occurs, and RAI (%) is the relative abundance index, a measure of the proportion of camera trap days on which a species was detected. White-tailed deer (in bold) was the most frequently detected species. Owl, river otter, and snowshoe hare (in bold) were the least frequently detected species.*

**2. Both replanted pine and deciduous forests supported a similar mammal diversity in St. Lawrence County.**
We measured mammal diversity in three ways. In Fig. 2, we measured species richness, which is measured as the number of unique species we detected on our cameras.

![SpecRichness.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/013229e2-a542-4c8a-87fc-93a13b37c042.png)
*Fig. 2 Mean mammal species richness observed at each forest type per season. Error bars display the standard deviation for each mean value.* 

In Fig. 3A, we measured Simpson's diversity index, which accounts for species richness and relative abundance. Shannon-Weiner diversity index, shown in Fig. 3B, also accounts for species richness and relative abundance.

*Fig. 3 Bar graph showing mean Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's diversity index observed at each forest type per season. Error bars display the standard deviation for each mean value.*


**3. We detected the fewest number of mammals in the winter and spring seasons. This makes sense because of overwintering behaviors, such as hibernation, which reduce mammal activity and therefore decrease the probability of detection by our cameras.**



**4. Working with citizen scientists for photo classification is an effective and accurate method to collect data. You classified our photos with 99% accuracy!**


Habitat conservation is not possible without invested human interest. Citizen science projects are successful methods to bring awareness to concepts such as wildlife corridors and the impacts of habitat fragmentation. The Algonquin to Adirondack corridor is a major resource for mammal movement. The more diverse the forests fragments are that connect the Adirondack and Algonquin parks, the greater the capacity for movement through the wildlife corridor. The information from our study can be used to help conservation biologists design the A2A wildlife corridor. We determined that although replanted pine forests had a similar mammal diversity to deciduous forests, forest type was not a statistically significant variable in predicting mammal diversity. Based on our results, forests in St. Lawrence County can likely support a wide range of mammals that might move through the corridor.

16. What will this information be used for?

## 1. How do I answer the "Precipitation" question? ##

We are interested in how animal activity relates to precipitation, so please check "Yes" if it is actively raining or snowing in the photo or "No" if it is not.  Just the presence of snow on the ground does not mean you should check "yes".

## 2. How do I determine the snow depth? ##

We have a scale bar in most of the photos - a section of white PVC pipe with black tape every 10cm.  The easiest way to measure the snow depth is to count from the top of the PVC, which is 40cm above the ground.  As your eye moves down the PVC rod, you subtract 10cm for every black band you pass. Thus, the maximum snow depth is 30-40cm and the minimum is 0-10cm. **If you cannot see the scale bar, just leave the question about snow depth blank.**

## 3. Does an animal have to be in all three images to count it? ##

No - each set of 3 images is considered 1 "event".  The cameras were programmed to take up to three photos in rapid-fire succession when triggered, so we are assuming that any animal present in any of the 3 photos was part of that particular event.  Look between all three photos - if there is an animal in any of the 3, go ahead and classify it.

## 4. Photos are in batches of 3. Do I need to classify each photo separately? 

No - since each set of 3 photos is considered a single event, we are assuming that any animal present in any of the 3 photos is the same animal, so you just need to count it once.  The software is set up to work this way.

## 5. When should I use the "Nothing here" selection? ##

You should use this choice sparingly, after first closely examining the photo. Check for movement by switching between photos, try inverting the photo, and zoom in on the photo before deciding that nothing is there.  If after all of that, you don't see an animal in **any** of the three photos in that set, you can choose "Nothing here."
"
## 6. When should I use the "Something here" selection? ##

There are sometimes photos in which you are sure an animal is present, but all you can make out is, for example, eye shine, and you just can't tell what the animal is. Check for movement by switching between photos, try inverting the photo, and zoom in on the photo before deciding that you cannot identify the animal.  If after all of that, you aren't sure what the animal is, you can choose "Something here." **If you have even a vague guess about what the animal is, please record it as your guess rather than selecting "Something here."**

## 7. What do I do if I see an animal, but can't identify it? ##
Check for movement by switching between photos, try inverting the photos, and zoom in on the photos before deciding that you cannot identify the animal.  If after all of that, you still aren't sure what the animal is,you can choose "Something here." In some cases, we only generally ID the animal.  For example, if you see what you think is a mouse, but might be a vole, you can choose "Other small mammal" as the identification. **If you have even a vague guess about what the animal is, please record it as your guess rather than selecting "Something here."**

## 8. What if I see an animal that is not on your list? ##

If you see an animal that is not on our list, choose "Other" in the classification menu.  You can then use the "talk" feature to leave a comment identifying the animal if you know what it is.

## 9. What should I do if the animal displays different behaviors in different photos of the same set? ##

Record all of the behaviors that you observe in the full set of 3 photos - this will help us get an idea of the general behaviors of that particular species.  If in one frame a gray squirrel is standing and in the next it appears to be digging, record both behaviors.

## 10. What do I do if there is more than I kind of animal in the set of photos? ##

First, celebrate!  These kinds of events are fairly unusual in our project!  Then classify the first animal, but rather than selecting "Done" at the end, select the next species on the list and answer the questions about it.  Only when you have all of the species recorded should you move on.

## 11. If I make a mistake, can I return to the photo to correct it? ##

No,you can't go back and fix a mistake, but don't worry!  We have lots of volunteers working on the project, so each photo is seen by many eyes.  We are just grateful that you're helping us!

## 12. Can I collect or share photos from North Country Wild? ##
Yes!  We hope you are excited by some of the photos you see!  However, we'd like you to ascribe credit to North Country Wild, and mention the creative commons license so folks know how they can use the images.  **You may not use any of the photos for commercial purposes.**

## 13. How can I discuss a photo with others? ##

When you are done with the classifcation, choose the "Done and Talk" button rather than the "Done" button and a talk window will open where you can make comments about the image and others will be able to see your comments and respond.  
## 14. What if I see something in the photo that I want to tell the scientists about? ##

We hope you will!  Again, choose the "Done and Talk" button at the end of the classification and post your question. If you use a hashtag to categorize your question, such as #injury or #behavior it will help collect similar questions together.

## 15. How can I ask a question that is not in this FAQ? ##
Start by clicking "Talk" at the top of the page.  If you don’ t find the answer you are looking for, click on the relevant forum under “Help”. At the bottom of the page, you can create a new discussion. We check the forums and answer as many questions as we can, as often as we can. Experienced Zooniverse volunteers may also participate in these discussions and offer their ideas and advice. 

## 16. What will this information be used for? ##

Great question!  While it is fun to look at images and classify them on the Zooniverse, it takes a huge amount of field work and computer work to get all of these images onto the Zooniverse, so we must have a good reason!  The short version: We are studying how mammals use habitat in northern New York state, on both public and private land, to better undrestand how to conserve habitat.  Our goal is to help advise land use plans in establishing the Algonquin to Adirondack biocorridor.  Feel free to read more by clicking the "About" link at the top of the page and then selecting "Research."  And remember - it would be really tough to do this work without help from volunteers like you, so **THANK YOU!**
