## Welcome to the North Country Wild Project! ##

We're glad you're here! This field guide is designed to help you as you volunteer on our project. If you'd like to get more general information about North Country Wild, please read more on our [About page](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/barthelmess/north-country-wild/about/research).

There are currently two workflows in our project. When we initially push images to the project, you may not see both workflows as options.  The workflows that are active are shown under the words "Get started" on the project landing page:

![select_workflows.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/988ae3df-434f-4294-a9c7-c8ed5e64fdfb.png)

The first workflow, called "Is there an animal?", asks volunteers to look at sets of images and decide whether or not there are any animals in the pictures. This is the first workflow to be activated whenever we add subjects to the project.

Those sets of images that are determined to have animals in them are passed to a second workflow called "Species Identification."  In this second workflow, volunteers identify the animals in each set of images and answer a few questions about them.

When both workflows are available, volunteers have their choice of which one to work on.

This field guide is set up to explain:

1.  Common features between workflows
2.  How to respond in each workflow
2.  How to answer questions appropriately
3.  How to measure snow depth and
4.  Why the heck there is a PVC stake in most photos!

Read on!

[//]: # (Getting Started with Workflows)

    ## Getting Started with Workflows ##

Thanks for helping us identify animals from our camera trap images. The images have been collected from forests across St. Lawrence County in northern New York State.  We do most of our camera trapping during August - December of each calendar year, which means we have photos available for classification usually starting in November and lasting into January and February, depending on how many images and volunteers we have.

We have two workflows for processing images. Toward the beginning of each season, only the first workflow, called **Is there an Animal?** will be active. In this workflow, volunteers look at sets of images and decide if they contain animals.  Those sets of images that do contain animals are passed to the second workflow for further analysis. Once enough of the images in the **Is there an Animal?** workflow have been processed, the second workflow, called **Species Identification** becomes active.

## Common workflow features ##

There are common features to all of our workflows. Our cameras are set to take pictures in bursts of up to three images. Thus, we consider each set of images to be an "event". In every workflow, the user is asked to look at the set of images. Navigation among the images in each set is the same in every workflow.

As you can see in the picture below, you can move through the images in a set using either the **play** button in the lower-left corner of the screen or by clicking on the dots in the lower-middle of the screen.

![IsThereAnimal_play.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/b0dd333e-304f-45bb-8c67-b7cbcad8a5dc.png)

There are additional tools to help you. To the top right of each image is a set of tools that lets you zoom and pan around the image, and at the bottom right of each image is a set of tools that lets you collect "favorite" images. 

![nav_tools.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/0c490a9c-0e71-44a0-ba4d-72938d9fd0c4.png)

Looking more closely at the bottom set of tools, we see:

![additional_tools.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/b4889405-b5a5-4c33-8890-13428e4b09c0.png)

From left to right, these buttons allow you to:
- invert the image color profile so darks become light and lights become dark
- view metadata about the image
- save the image to your favorites
- add the image to a themed collection.

## Is there an animal? ##

In the first workflow, volunteers are asked to help us sort pictures into those that have animals (including humans) and those that do not. 

On the left side of the screen you will be presented with a set of 1 to 3 images (not all captures have 3 images). We consider each set of 3 images a single "event." 

Navigate through the set of images. Either click the "play" button in the lower left corner of the screen or click through the  dots in the lower center of the screen.

Flipping through the 3 images can help you glimpse movement of a hard-to-find animal.  Look carefully at each image, as some animals can be tricky to find.

![IsThereAnimal_play.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/b0dd333e-304f-45bb-8c67-b7cbcad8a5dc.png)

## Make your determination ##

Once you have examined the image(s), choose whether there is an animal in the event by selecting either "Yes" or "I don't think so".  To complete your selection, choose either "Done" if you are ready to move on to the next image, or "Done & Talk" if you'd like to comment or ask a question about the image before moving on.

![IsThereAnimalDone.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/13178a21-86f3-4f95-a355-8b6a981e03d9.png)

[//]: # (Species Identification)

## Species Identification ##

In this workflow, volunteers identify the animal species that are present in each set of images and answer questions about them.

On the left side of the screen you will be presented with a set of 1 to 3 images (not all captures have 3 images). We consider each set of 3 images a single "event." 

Navigate through the set of images. Either click the “play” button in the lower left corner of the screen or click through the dots in the lower center of the screen. 

Flipping through the 3 images can help you glimpse movement of a hard-to-find animal.  Look carefully at each image, as some animals can be tricky to find.

![deer_choices_1.jpg](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/17c4b6ef-01cb-47ab-97e5-a5e6a2670fc1.jpeg)

To the right is an alphabetical list of commonly-seen animals from our region.  Choose a species to begin your classification by clicking on its name. Note that humans are listed last. You are required to select a species even if you are not sure of exactly what animal is in the image.

![deer_choice1.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/b8ae8df5-2c43-411e-bc3b-49903a4b841a.png)

## Filters can help ##
In the upper right at the top of the list of species names are some filters that allow you to narrow down the possible choices by features such as body size. Click on a filter to limit the possible choices. 

![use_species_filter.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/52de3a4b-83db-4f0b-9c4d-bedc074e939b.png)

## Answer questions ##
If the species you have selected is a mammal (or some bird species), a species description and set of questions will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Use the species description, along with the “Often confused with” choices to build confidence in your answer.

Identify how many individuals of your species are present. 

Identify any of the behavior(s) that the animals are doing. You can choose more than one behavior if applicable. See the next chapter in the field guide to get more explanation about how to answer the questions.

![deer_questions copy.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/c068e45a-8537-44d7-8016-f7d4d34c4250.png)

## Identify snow depth ##
To finish, identify the snow depth. There is a PVC pipe marked out with black tape in most pictures. The top tape ring represents 30 cm, and there are 2 black rings below at 10 cm intervals. If 2 rings are visible, then 1 is covered by snow, so there is 10-20 cm on the ground. ![snow_depth.jpg](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/8200ec34-e103-4418-80dd-c4ba363a98c7.jpeg)

You can read more about measuring snow depth in the **How to measure snow depth** chapter of the Field guide.

**After you have answered all the questions, click IDENTIFY**

## Check for additional species ##
Remember, there might be more than one species present in the set of images.  If so, each needs to be recorded.  After you click "Identify" for the first species, you will be taken back to the main page. If there are more species present, step through the identification process again for each one.  With each species you identify, a small blue tag appears in the bottom left corner of the photo listing your choice(s). If you made a mistake, click the ‘X’ to remove a species assignment.

When you have identified all of the species in the set of images, choose either "Done" if you are ready to move on to the next image, or "Done & Talk" if you'd like to comment or ask a question about the image before moving on.

    ## Answering Questions ##

For certain species (all mammals and some birds) we are collecting additional information. A number of questions are presented after you make a species identification in the **Species Identification** workflow.

The first question asks you to estimate the number of individuals of the species present in the set of images. You have the following choices:

- ' 1 '
- ' 2-3 '
- ' >3 '

Your answer should estimate the total number of individuals present in aggregate among all three images in each subject set. For example, if three deer are walking through a scene, and you can see one of them in the first image, two of them in the second image, and 3 of them in the third image, you would choose "2-3" as your answer.

The second question asks you to identify any behaviors that you see. Here you can choose as many as you can observe. Each choice, along with a description of what it means, is found in the following table:

| Behavior name | Description |
|-|-|
| Alert | Animal appears to be vigilant; looking attentive to its surroundings |
| Climbing | Animal is ascending or descending an object (stump, tree trunk, branch) rather than moving along the ground |
| Digging | Animal is using its paws to scratch in the soil or leaves |
| Flying/Gliding | Animal is moving through the air, either actively (flying) or passively (gliding) |
| Foraging/Eating | Animal appears to be looking for food (foraging) or consuming food (eating). Chewing the cud in deer or moose should not be considered eating. |
| Grooming | Animal is maintaining its body by e.g. licking its coat. If the animal is grooming another animal, choose both "Grooming" and "Interacting" |
| Interacting | Animal is engaged in social behavior with another animal, e.g. through nursing, following closely, grooming, or similar. |
| Jumping | Animal is moving from one place to another by pushing from one object to another or by springing forward from its legs |
| Sitting/Standing/Lying | Animal is still and not moving |
| Walking/Running | Animal is moving across the view without jumping, flying, or gliding |
| Other | Select this choice if you observe a behavior not listed among the choices |

The third question asks you to estimate snow depth in the set of images by comparing snow against the "scale bar" - a pieces of white PVC pipe marked out in 10 cm increments with black tape. Detailed instructions are provided in the next chapter of the field guide, **How to measure snow depth**

The fourth question only applies if there are moose or deer in the image. This question asks you to determine if the animal has antlers. Antlers are only borne by male deer and moose, so their presence can help us to determine the sex of animals in the photos. However, antlers are shed at the end of the breeding season. So, the absence of antlers does not mean an animal is female, but the presence of antlers does indicate that the animal is male. Please don't guess - just leave the question blank if you can't tell.

When you identify humans in a set of images, you will be asked whether the human is a camera trapper, hunter, recreationalist, or other. Use the following information to help you decide:

**Camera trappers** are members of our team who are actively deploying or taking down cameras. We take pictures at the start and end of every deployment to help make sure the camera is working properly. Camera trappers tend to be standing right in front of the camera, may be alone or in a group of 1-3 people, and often can be seen holding clipboards or other equipment and bending in the foreground of the photos.

**Hunters** are often moving past the camera without appearing to notice it. They are usually dressed in some form of camoflauge, are usually wearing some bright orange, and can usually be seen carrying a gun.

**Other** is the category to assign to people who are photographed while enjoying the woods for hiking, biking, or other activities but **not hunting or setting up/taking down camera traps**. 

[//]: # (How to measure snow depth)

    As you might imagine, snow can make it hard to move through the woods.  We'd like to get a sense of the relationship between snow depth and animal activity.  Thus, when you see an animal in the picture, please also try to estimate the snow depth by selecting the appropriate answer to the question. Here's how:

1. **Locate the scale stick in the photo**.  The scale stick is a piece of PVC pipe taped out every 10 cm with electrical tape.  In a few cases, the scale stick is missing, knocked over, behind vegetation, or totally covered in snow.

2. The scale stick is 40 cm long total.  10 cm at the bottom are underground. Thus, **the stick shows 30 cm above ground, marked out in 10 cm increments**.  

![snow_depth.jpg](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/8200ec34-e103-4418-80dd-c4ba363a98c7.jpeg)

The choices for snow depth are the following: 

![snow_depth_qs.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/774d3ad3-6bce-4030-8260-0b642b2b7778.png)

Measuring from the top of the scale stick (30 cm), count down to the location of the snow. In this cute example, a fisher is gnawing on the scale stick.  How deep is the snow?  

![fisher_chewing_square_notes.jpg](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/d621dfe0-7d50-42f1-8825-7857d007c2d1.jpeg)

If you said dusting - 10 cm, you are correct!

How deep is the snow in this picture with a cute winter-phase weasel?

![scale_weasel_square.jpg](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/8db9bfd0-4ce1-4aca-b8da-7b4a141365d7.jpeg)

Dusting to 10 cm again!  

How about in this one?

![snow_depth_4.jpeg](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/0d6a224d-4489-478f-8634-5f90960b1580.jpeg)

If you said "10-20 cm" you're right!

Looks like you've got the hang of it!

[//]: # (Why is there a PVC stake in the photo?)

We use PVC stakes as "scales" in our photos, for several reasons.  First, they let us estimate the snow depth when animals trigger the camera. Second, they help us estimate the size of animals.  The scales are all set the same distance away from each camera, and we know the height of each scale stick. We can use that information to estimate the size of animals in the pictures. While we already know that a moose is bigger than a muskrat, sometimes we only catch part of an animal in a picture.  For example, both mountain lions and domestic cats have long tails - if we just get a tail shot from a camera, the scale stick lets us measure the length of the tail, and we can us that information to more accurately identify species.
