## Introduction

The North Country region in northern New York State (United States) is situated within the Adirondack mountains and the St. Lawrence River Valley. Our natural resources are plentiful and dictate some of the economic opportunities in the area. Human population density is low and wild lands abound. 

With the North Country Wild project, we seek to know more about the wild animals with whom we share this remarkable landscape. By deploying "camera traps" (game cameras) across the landscape, we can not only determine  which species live here with us, but can also learn about their unique habitat needs, with the ultimate aim of informing how to manage our landscape to provide connectivity with Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario and to support coexistence of humans and wildlife while building resilience to a changing climate.

## Workflow description
At the outset, only the "Is there an animal?" workflow is active. As subjects are retired, those with animals will populate the "Species Identification" workflow, at which point it will become active and volunteers can work on either workflow.

## Research quote

We share our home with so many interesting animals, yet still know so little about them. Please help us deepen our understanding of our non-human neighbors
