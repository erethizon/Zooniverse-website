[//]: # (Step 1 - welcome)
## Welcome! ##
Thanks for helping us identify animals from our camera trap images. The images have been collected from forests across St. Lawrence County in northern New York State.  

The next several tutorial slides with guide you through the process. You can also view the field guide for more detailed instructions.

[//]: # (Step 2 - find some animals)

## Find some animals! ## 
On the left side of the screen you will be presented with a set of 1 to 3 images (not all captures have 3 images). We consider each set of 3 images a single "event." 


Navigate through the set of images. Either click the “play” button in the lower left corner of the screen or click through the dots in the lower center of the screen. 

Flipping through the 3 images can help you glimpse movement of a hard-to-find animal.  Look carefully at each image, as some animals can be tricky to find.

[//]: # (Step 3 - zoom, pan, collect)

## Zoom, pan, and collect your favorite images ##

On the upper right side of each image is a set of tools that can help you examine the image by zooming in and out or panning.

You can save your favorite images by clicking the heart on the lower right of the image or by adding the image to a collection.

[//]: # (Step 4 - Identify animals)

## Identify animals ##
To the right is an alphabetical list of commonly-seen animals from our region.  Choose a species to begin your classification by clicking on its name. Note that humans are listed last. You are required to select a species even if you are not sure of exactly what animal is in the image.

[//]: # (Step 5 - filters can help)

## Filters can help ##
In the upper right at the top of the list of species names are some filters that allow you to narrow down the possible choices by features such as body size. Click on a filter to limit the possible choices.

[//]: # (Step 6 - Answer questions)

## Answer questions ##
If the species you have selected is a mammal (or some birds), a species description and set of questions will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Use the species description, along with the “Often confused with” choices to build confidence in your answer.

Identify how many individuals of your species are present. 

Identify any of the behavior(s) that the animals are doing. You can choose more than one behavior if applicable.

[//]: # (Step 7 - Identify snow depth)

## Identify snow depth ##
To finish, identify the snow depth. There is a PVC pipe marked out with black tape in most pictures. The top tape ring represents 30 cm, and there are 2 black rings below at 10 cm intervals. If 2 rings are visible, then 1 is covered by snow, so there is 10-20 cm on the ground. ![snow_depth.jpg](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/8200ec34-e103-4418-80dd-c4ba363a98c7.jpeg)

Here's an example to test yourself. How deep is the snow in this picture?

If you selected 0 - 10 cm, you're right! See below for why:

After you have answered all the questions, click “Identify.”

[//]: # (Step 8 - Check for additional species)

## Check for additional species ##
Remember, there might be more than one species present in the set of images.  If so, each needs to be recorded.  After you click "Identify" for the first species, you will be taken back to the main page. If there are more species present, step through the identification process again for each one.  With each species you identify, a small blue tag appears in the bottom left corner of the photo listing your choice(s). If you made a mistake, click the ‘X’ to remove a species assignment.

When you have identified all of the species in the set of images, choose either "Done" if you are ready to move on to the next image, or "Done & Talk" if you'd like to comment or ask a question about the image before moving on.
