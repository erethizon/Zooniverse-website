[//]: # (Step 1 - Welcome)
## Welcome! ##

Help us sort pictures into those that have animals (including humans) and those that do not. 

The next several tutorial slides will walk you through the process.

[//]: # (Step 2 -Is there an animal)

## Is there a human or other animal? ## 
On the left side of the screen you will be presented with a set of 1 to 3 images (not all captures have 3 images). We consider each set of 3 images a single "event." 

Navigate through the set of images. Either click the "play" button in the lower left corner of the screen or click through the  dots in the lower center of the screen.

Flipping through the 3 images can help you glimpse movement of a hard-to-find animal.  Look carefully at each image, as some animals can be tricky to find.

[//]: # (Step 3 - Collect favorites )

## Collect your favorites! ##

On the upper right side of each image is a set of tools that can help you examine the image by zooming in and out or panning.

You can save your favorite images by clicking the heart on the lower right of the image or by adding the image to a collection.

[//]: # (Step 4 - Make determination)

## Make your determination ##

Once you have examined the image(s), it is time to make  your determination. If there is a human in any of the set of  images (even if there is another animal like a dog as well), select "Yes, I see at least one human".

If there is at least one animal but no humans in the set of images, select "Yes, I see at least one animal (but NO humans)".

If you don't see humans or any other animals in the set of images, select "No, I don't think there is a human or other animal in any of the images". To complete your selection, choose either "Done" if you are ready to move on to the next image, or "Done & Talk" if you'd like to comment or ask a question about the image before moving on.
