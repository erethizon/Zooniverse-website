[//]: # (Step 1 - Welcome)

## Welcome! ##
Thanks for helping us identify animals from our camera trap images. The images have been collected from forests across St. Lawrence County in northern New York State.  

The next several tutorial slides with guide you through the process. You can also view the field guide for more detailed instructions.

[//]: # (Step 2 - Find animals)

## Find some animals! ## 
On the left side of the screen you will be presented with a set of 1 to 3 images (not all captures have 3 images). We consider each set of 3 images a single "event." For each event you will identify the number of individuals of each species present in each set of 3 photos.

Navigate through the set of images. Flipping through the 3 images can help you glimpse movement of a hard-to-find animal.  Look carefully at each image, as some animals can be tricky to find.

[//]: # (Step 3 - Identify animals)

## Identify visible animals ##
To the right is an alphabetical list of commonly-seen animals from our region.  Choose a species to begin your classification.

[//]: # (Step 4 - Answer questions)

## Answer questions ##
Identify how many of your species are present and if any of them are young. For deer and moose, please also identify if they have antlers yet. 

Identify any of the behavior(s) that the species is doing. You can choose more than one behavior if applicable. Also identify whether it is actively snowing/raining.

[//]: # (Step 5 - Measure snow depth)

## Identify snow depth ##
To finish, identify the snow depth. There is a PVC pipe marked out with black tape in most pictures. The top tape ring represents 30 cm, and there are 2 black rings below at 10 cm intervals. If 2 rings are visible, then 1 is covered by snow, so there is 10-20 cm on the ground. ![snow_depth.jpg](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/production/project_attached_image/8200ec34-e103-4418-80dd-c4ba363a98c7.jpeg)

Here's an example to test yourself. How deep is the snow in this picture?

If you selected 0 - 10 cm, you're right! See below for why:

[//]: # (Step 6 - Finalize choice)

## Finalize your choice ##
Now click identify! A small blue tag will appear in the bottom left corner of the photo. Click the 'X' to remove it if you made a mistake.

In this example, I made a mistake.  There is *not* a porcupine in the event, so I can cancel my choice by clicking the "X" on the blue box beneath the photo.

[//]: # (Step 7 - Check for more)

## Check for additional species ##

Remember, there might be more than one species present in the set of images.  If so, each needs to be recorded.  After you click "Identify" for the first species, go back to the main page and select the second species from the list of choices. Once you are finished identifying ALL of the species in the set of photos, either click "Done" to move to the next image or "Done and Talk" to leave us a note about the event.

[//]: # (Step 8 - Don't worry)

## Don't Worry!! ##
If you are having trouble identifying the species use the "Something Here" tag and we'll take a look at it. You can also click "Done & Talk" to put a written comment with the photos. If you have any general questions or comments, please submit them to our [Talk](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/barthelmess/north-country-wild-phase-1/talk) page. 

[//]: # (Step 9 - Have fun)

## Have Fun! ##

We hope you enjoy helping us and learning more about species in the North Country.  If you see any pictures you really like, (perhaps of a nice big buck for example):

you can save them as favorites or add them to collections as long as you are logged in.
